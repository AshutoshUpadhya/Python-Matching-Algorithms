# Python-Matching-Algorithms
Code samples and comparisons of text matching algorithms

https://github.com/DruidSmith/Python-Matching-Algorithms/blob/master/String%20Comparison.ipynb
This is a Jupyter notebook with Python 3.x examples of getting text match scores via various algorithms and packages, such as difflib, jellyfish and fuzzywuzzy

As this effort progresses, there will be a more robust example and potentially a more thorough correlation/machine learning exercise to evaluate which algorithms work well for a specific use case (company names) and potentially an ensemble methodology

Comparison.ipynb https://github.com/DruidSmith/Python-Matching-Algorithms/blob/master/Comparison.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook which imports a test file (companies.csv) and creates a pandas dataframe and populates it with the results of the various algorithms.
